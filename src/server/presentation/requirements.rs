precedes code; without control it also precedes bundled stdin. Failure or a required restart \
withholds the cell. \
Compatible additions preserve live state on an idle worker; other changes need restart. \
With restart, candidate resolution precedes replacement; resolution failure preserves the \
current worker and sends no stdin/code. Standalone preparation rejects nonempty stdin. \

support reject the combination before signaling or input. Otherwise interrupt and stdin \
precede deferred validation/preparation and are not rolled back on failure.",
