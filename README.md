# `mcp-console`

# 🚧 UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🚧

**This project is not ready for use.**

`mcp-console` is a ground-up rewrite of [`mcp-repl`](https://github.com/posit-dev/mcp-repl).
It applies the lessons learned from `mcp-repl` to a substantially different product---different enough that a new name makes sense.

The repository currently contains the initial Rust binary package.
The following commands are implemented:

```bash
mcp-console
mcp-console serve
mcp-console --version
mcp-console sandbox -- COMMAND [ARG]...
```

`mcp-console` and `mcp-console serve` run a minimal MCP server over stdio.
The server registers one `console` tool that accepts a JSON object and returns that object as JSON text.
It does not execute code or retain state yet.

On macOS, `sandbox` launches the command under `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`.
The command can read the host filesystem, can write regular files only in a dedicated temporary directory, and cannot access the network.
The policy also permits the device and IPC operations needed for supported R and Python workflows, including sandbox-created PTYs and Python multiprocessing semaphores.
This initial launcher waits only for the direct command.
Background descendants are unsupported: they may outlive the launcher, which attempts to remove their dedicated temporary directory on a best-effort basis when it returns.
Descendant supervision is intentionally deferred because it must account for process groups, session-detached children, signal forwarding, and PID reuse together.
Linux and Windows are not supported yet.

The proposed product and architecture remain under [`design-sketches/`](design-sketches/README.md).

## Development
