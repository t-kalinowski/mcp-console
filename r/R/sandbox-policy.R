#' Configure sandbox filesystem and network access
#'
#' A `SandboxPolicy()` describes which files sandboxed code can read or change
#' and which network connections it can make. Build a policy from the
#' `SandboxFilesystem()` and `SandboxNetwork()` constructors, then pass it to
#' `console_tool(config = ConsoleConfig(sandbox = policy))`. The same object
#' can also be supplied as
#' `ConsoleConfig(resolver = ResolverConfig(sandbox = policy))` to configure
#' dependency preparation separately.
#'
#' With `SandboxPolicy()`, workers can read host files and write their private
#' temporary storage, but cannot write to the project or use the network.
#' Add permissions for the operations your code needs. This default permits
#' reading sensitive files unless you explicitly deny their paths.
#' `console_tool()` also skips configuration-file discovery by default.
#' An explicit policy replaces permissions from any files you opt into reading.
#' To disable sandboxing for both workers and preparation, use
#' `ConsoleConfig(sandbox = FALSE)`.
#'
#' @section Reading and writing files:
#' `SandboxFilesystem()` groups paths by the access you want to permit:
#'
#' * `read_write` permits reads and changes beneath each path. Use `"."` to
#'   permit project writes, or `"./output"` to permit only an output directory.
#' * `read_only` permits reads and prevents writes where it overrides a
#'   broader writable path. For example, permit project writes but protect
#'   `"./data"` with `read_only = "./data"`.
#' * `deny` blocks reading and writing the named paths and their contents.
#'   Use it for files the worker should not see, such as `"./secrets"`.
#'
#' More specific paths take precedence over broader paths. At the same path,
#' `deny` wins over `read_write`, then `read_only`; list order has no effect.
#' Adding a `read_only` path does not make all other host files unreadable.
#' Workers retain their host-read baseline.
#'
#' Paths are literal, without globs or automatic `~` or environment-variable
#' expansion. Relative paths use `console_tool(project = ...)`. Changing the
#' worker's directory later does not move those grants. To deny a home-directory
#' path, construct an
#' absolute path explicitly, for example `file.path(path.expand("~"), ".ssh")`.
#' The wrapper does not resolve symlinks or create configured directories.
#' Create writable directories before launching; directory roots are the
#' portable choice. Linux skips absent write roots and can reject file roots.
#' Linux mount masking can also prevent a narrower read exception beneath a
#' denied directory from being visible.
#'
#' The runner normally protects `.git`, `.agents`, `.codex`, and `.aws` from
#' writes beneath writable roots. Explicit grants can override these protections.
#' If you grant an ancestor of the project, list protected project paths in
#' `read_only` explicitly. Add `"./.claude"` there if it should also be protected.
#'
#' @section Choosing network access:
#' The `network` argument selects one of three arrangements:
#'
#' * `"restricted"` denies ordinary direct network access and starts no proxy.
#'   This is the worker default when `network = NULL`.
#' * `"enabled"` permits direct networking with the host's network access,
#'   without a managed proxy or domain filtering. Filesystem restrictions
#'   still apply; this does not disable the sandbox.
#' * `SandboxNetwork()` enables a managed proxy while restricting direct
#'   remote connections. Use its `proxy` argument to choose destinations and
#'   protocols. Clients use the proxy environment supplied to the worker;
#'   clients that ignore it cannot make ordinary direct remote connections.
#'
#' A bare `SandboxNetwork()` permits no worker proxy destinations. To call one
#' HTTPS API, supply `SandboxProxy(domains = SandboxDomains(allow =
#' "api.example.com"))`. The default proxy mode is `"full"`, which supports
#' HTTPS. An explicit `SandboxDomains()` replaces the destination defaults;
#' an empty `allow` list permits no destinations.
#'
#' @section What the proxy modes mean:
#' `SandboxProxy(mode = "full")` supports HTTP requests of any method and
#' HTTPS through CONNECT tunnels. CONNECT lets the client establish an
#' encrypted connection to an allowed destination; the proxy does not inspect
#' the HTTP methods inside that TLS connection. Destination rules still apply.
#' CONNECT and SOCKS tunnels can carry arbitrary application traffic to allowed
#' destinations.
#' `"full"` means these protocols are available, not that every host is allowed.
#'
#' `mode = "limited"` permits only plain HTTP GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests
#' to allowed destinations. The currently pinned runner rejects other methods,
#' including POST and HTTPS CONNECT, and disables SOCKS. Use `"full"` for
#' ordinary HTTPS APIs or package downloads. Limited mode does not provide
#' read-only HTTPS access or a guarantee against server-side changes: even a
#' GET request can have side effects. Direct local or Unix-socket access granted
#' separately is not subject to this HTTP method filter.
#'
#' The `socks5` argument controls an additional SOCKS5 proxy in full mode.
#' SOCKS5 lets a client tunnel protocols other than HTTP to allowed hosts:
#'
#' * `"tcp"` (the full-mode default) enables TCP tunnels.
#' * `"disabled"` disables SOCKS5 while leaving HTTP and HTTPS proxying enabled.
#' * `"tcp_udp"` requests TCP and UDP tunnels, but is unsupported by the
#'   currently pinned runner and fails before the command starts.
#'
#' With `mode = "limited"`, leave `socks5 = NULL`. Any explicitly supplied
#' value, including `"disabled"`, is an error. The limited mode itself disables
#' both SOCKS transports.
#'
#' `allow_upstream_proxy = TRUE` lets the managed proxy route onward through
#' HTTP(S) proxy settings in Console's trusted launch environment. The default
#' is `FALSE`. This can be useful behind a corporate proxy; destination and
#' method restrictions still apply. Environment changes made inside the worker
#' cannot select this upstream hop.
#'
#' @section Allowing and denying destinations:
#' `SandboxDomains(allow = ..., deny = ...)` accepts hostname patterns or IP
#' literals. A destination must match an allow rule and no deny rule. Deny
#' rules take precedence even over a more specific allow rule.
#'
#' * `"api.example.com"` matches only that host.
#' * `"*.example.com"` matches subdomains at any depth, but not `"example.com"`.
#' * `"**.example.com"` matches both the domain and its subdomains.
#' * `"127.0.0.1"` or `"::1"` matches that IP literal.
#'
#' Supply hostnames, not URLs or host-with-port strings: these rules cannot
#' restrict a URL path or destination port. Hosts serving redirects or downloaded
#' artifacts also need allow rules. Hostname matching ignores case and trailing
#' dots. When local binding is disabled, hostnames resolving to private addresses
#' are blocked even if allowlisted; explicitly allowed local IP literals can
#' still be reached through the proxy.
#'
#' @section Local applications and Unix sockets:
#' `SandboxNetwork(allow_local_binding = TRUE)` allows local networking needed
#' by development servers. For workers this defaults to `FALSE`; for dependency
#' preparation it defaults to `TRUE`. On macOS, enabling it allows loopback
#' listeners and direct connections to host loopback services, including their
#' HTTP or WebSocket traffic. Those direct connections bypass domain and proxy
#' method filtering. It also relaxes the proxy's private-address checks.
#'
#' For a Shiny app on macOS, allow project writes if needed, prepare `shiny`
#' with `RConfig(packages = "shiny")`, and enable local binding. Run the app with
#' `host = "127.0.0.1"` and `launch.browser = FALSE`, then open its URL in your
#' host browser. The app occupies its Console cell until interrupted; a short
#' call timeout returns while it keeps running. Wait for the `Listening on ...`
#' message before opening the URL; use `send(timeout_ms = 1000L)` to inspect
#' later output while startup is still running. See the complete example below.
#'
#' Linux's managed proxy uses a private network namespace. Local binding does
#' not publish its ports to a host browser. For host-browser Shiny development
#' on Linux, use `SandboxPolicy(network = "enabled")` with the filesystem grants
#' you need; this also permits remote networking. Use the same direct-network
#' choice on Windows, where managed proxy configurations are unsupported.
#'
#' `SandboxSockets(unix_sockets = ...)` permits direct Unix-domain socket
#' connections, for example to a local service. Use literal absolute paths;
#' `character()` permits none, and `"dangerously_allow_all"` permits all such
#' sockets subject to filesystem permissions. These channels can carry arbitrary
#' traffic and bypass the proxy's HTTP filter. On macOS, native direct grants
#' use subpath matching rather than an exact-path firewall. Linux rejects
#' nonempty path lists; its allow-all setting is supported without path filtering.
#'
#' @section Defaults, omissions, and dependency preparation:
#' Worker permissions and resolver permissions are independent. Package
#' preparation keeps its own host-read/cache-write defaults and, on macOS and
#' Linux, a full proxy with an allowlist for package repositories and downloads.
#' Denying a worker path or hostname does not deny it to preparation. Limit the
#' resolver separately with `ResolverConfig(sandbox = ...)` when needed.
#' Replacing resolver domains removes its repository allowlist. Include every
#' repository, artifact, and redirect host needed by your R, Python, and DuckDB
#' packages; limiting it to PyPI will prevent downloads from CRAN, for example.
#' An omitted resolver filesystem retains cache grants; an explicit filesystem
#' replaces its default entries, so include necessary reads and cache writes.
#' Explicit resolver sandbox policies are unsupported on Windows, where
#' preparation runs with host permissions.
#'
#' `NULL` means omit the property and use that context's default. A constructed
#' empty object is an explicit empty mapping; `character()` is an explicit empty
#' list. For example, `SandboxProxy(domains = NULL)` retains the resolver's
#' generated download allowlist, whereas `SandboxProxy(domains =
#' SandboxDomains(allow = character()))` permits no proxy destinations. In a
#' worker, both have an empty destination list. An explicit network scalar
#' removes the managed proxy, including the resolver's generated download proxy.
#'
#' `as.list(policy)` returns a recursive, JSON-ready application configuration.
#' It preserves omitted fields, empty mappings, and arrays, including singletons.
#' No native defaults are baked into these R objects. Console and its pinned
#' native runner validate and enforce platform capabilities. Unsupported settings
#' fail; the wrapper does not retry with broader permissions.
#'
#' @param read_only,read_write,deny Character vectors of literal filesystem
#'   paths granting reads, reads and writes, or denying both, respectively.
#'   For `SandboxDomains()`, `deny` instead contains hostname patterns or IP
#'   literals whose proxy connections should be blocked.
#' @return An S7 configuration object. The constructor is also its S7 class.
