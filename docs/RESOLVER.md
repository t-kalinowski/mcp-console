# Dependency resolver configuration

The resolver selects environments and prepares packages separately from evaluated code.
Giving a worker network or filesystem access does not give the resolver the same access, and vice versa.

On macOS and Linux, default preparation runs in a native sandbox with host-file reads, private temporary and dependency-cache writes, and a download proxy.
Windows preparation uses host permissions and an owned Job for process cleanup; a Job is not a sandbox.
`--no-sandbox` also uses host permissions.

Package builds and interpreter hooks execute code.
Use trusted requirements, package sources, tools, and configuration.
See [the trust boundary](#trust-boundary).

## Selecting resolver tools

Without R, managed Python requires `uv` on the launch PATH; there is no managed fallback to a system Python.
An [existing Python environment](CONFIGURATION.md#python-environment-selection) bypasses managed Python preparation.

With R, preparation prefers PATH `ir` (at least 0.4.0), then `uv tool run --from r-lib-ir ir`, with reticulate bootstrap when available.
A genuinely unavailable bootstrap can leave a bare R runtime; a selected bootstrap that fails is an error.
`RETICULATE_UV` affects the R-backed Python preparation path, not R-free preparation.

## Cache locations

Sandboxed sessions default to `cache: console`:

| Platform | Default dependency directory                    |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `$HOME/.cache/mcp-console/dependencies`         |
| macOS    | `$HOME/Library/Caches/mcp-console/dependencies` |
| Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/mcp-console/cache/dependencies` |

An absolute `XDG_CACHE_HOME` selects `<XDG_CACHE_HOME>/mcp-console/dependencies` on every platform.
Windows has user-profile/home fallbacks when `LOCALAPPDATA` is unavailable.
Selection uses the resolver's effective environment and is captured for the server connection.
`MCP_CONSOLE_HOME` moves configuration and recordings, not these caches.

Console redirects supported package/cache variables beneath that directory.
Worker plotting and general-purpose caches use private temporary storage, with prepared caches reused where supported.
Existing Python preserves its configured user-site package location.
[Environment variables](ENVIRONMENT.md#cache-and-data-locations) lists the assignments.

To share ordinary host installations and caches:

```yaml
cache: host
```

This retains resolver sandboxing on macOS/Linux but changes the default cache locations and write grants.
Shared cache writes can affect artifacts later used outside Console.
`--no-sandbox` defaults to host caches and rejects `cache: console`.

The companion's source/build cache is separate from dependency caches.
It is not worker-writable under the default policy.

## Configuration

To use a private package mirror:

```yaml
resolver:
  environment:
    UV_INDEX_URL: https://packages.example.org/simple
  sandbox:
    network:
      proxy:
        domains:
          allow: [packages.example.org, artifacts.example.org]
```

Include every host serving artifacts and redirects, plus other package sources needed by the session.
An explicit `domains` mapping replaces the **generated** default allowlist; `{}` allows no destinations.
Ordinary file/CLI mapping merges still apply before defaults are generated.

`resolver.sandbox` uses the [public sandbox schema](SANDBOX_CONFIGURATION.md).
Omitted networking retains the download proxy on macOS/Linux.
Explicit `network: restricted` or `network: enabled` removes it.
Limited proxy mode does not support HTTPS CONNECT and therefore cannot perform ordinary HTTPS downloads.

Top-level `environment` values also reach preparation.
`resolver.environment` overrides individual shared values.
`resolver.inherit_environment` defaults to the top-level setting.
Console's runtime, cache, proxy, and transport assignments take precedence.
Worker environment mutations do not reconfigure later preparation.

Windows rejects explicit `resolver.sandbox` settings rather than pretending to enforce them.
Environment and cache settings remain usable there.
`--no-sandbox` also rejects explicit sandbox policies.

## Filesystem grants

Omitting `resolver.sandbox.filesystem` retains generated host reads and cache writes.
**An explicit filesystem mapping replaces those default entries.** Supply necessary reads and writes yourself:

```yaml
cache: host
resolver:
  environment:
    UV_CACHE_DIR: /home/alice/package-caches/uv
  sandbox:
    filesystem:
      read_only: [/]
      read_write: [/home/alice/package-caches/uv]
```

This grants only the selected uv cache; Python installations, R libraries, and DuckDB can need additional writable paths.
Create custom writable directories before Linux launch.
Paths are launch-relative and do not expand `~` or environment variables.

To select that cache while retaining generated host-cache grants, omit the filesystem mapping:

```yaml
cache: host
resolver:
  environment:
    UV_CACHE_DIR: /home/alice/package-caches/uv
```

Console does not read uv configuration files to infer extra writable paths.
Expose a custom cache path through the corresponding environment variable or grant it explicitly.
In Console cache mode, Console's cache assignments take precedence.

## Expanded public default

The macOS/Linux download policy is equivalent to the following networking configuration.
Omit the filesystem mapping to retain generated cache and temporary-storage permissions.

```yaml
resolver:
  sandbox:
    network:
      proxy:
        mode: full
        socks5: tcp
        allow_upstream_proxy: false
        domains:
          allow:
            - pypi.org
            - files.pythonhosted.org
            - astral.sh
            - releases.astral.sh
            - github.com
            - api.github.com
            - codeload.github.com
            - raw.githubusercontent.com
            - objects.githubusercontent.com
            - release-assets.githubusercontent.com
            - r-lib.github.io
            - packagemanager.posit.co
            - rspm-sync.rstudio.com
            - bioconductor.posit.co
            - bioconductor.org
            - cran.r-project.org
            - cloud.r-project.org
            - cran.rstudio.com
            - extensions.duckdb.org
      sockets:
        unix_sockets: []
      allow_local_binding: true
```

Local binding permits installer coordination.
On macOS it also permits host loopback access and DNS; Linux uses a private network namespace.
This is not the Windows resolver policy.

## Host cache selection

With `cache: host`, explicit tool variables select locations and corresponding default resolver write grants.
The principal variables are `UV_CACHE_DIR`, `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`, `UV_TOOL_DIR`, `IR_CACHE_DIR`, `IR_LIBRARY_ROOT`, `RENV_PATHS_*`, `PKG_CACHE_DIR`, `R_PKG_CACHE_DIR`, and `MPLCONFIGDIR`.

Without overrides, uv uses its cache/data locations under XDG directories or the user's home.
R-related caches use `R_USER_CACHE_DIR`, then `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, then R's platform cache base.
Reticulate, ir, renv, and package caches occupy their respective subdirectories.
Default host-cache grants require an absolute resolver `HOME`.

Use `MCP_CONSOLE_DUCKDB_EXTENSION_DIRECTORY` for a custom host extension cache.
Otherwise managed installation and SQL use `.duckdb/extensions` under the resolver's effective home.
The location is captured; changing it in a cell does not reconfigure preparation.
Explicit filesystem policies must grant its writes.

Exact platform fallbacks and generated grants are implemented in [`src/resolver/cache.rs`](../src/resolver/cache.rs).
Do not copy those implementation formulas into other guides.

## Trust boundary

Preparation can read host files and modify its granted caches.
Console cache mode separates artifacts from ordinary host caches; it does not make them immutable, inspect package code, or protect readable secrets.

Keep selected resolver executables, wrappers, installation directories, source files, and configuration outside worker-writable paths.
Captured names and interpreter identity checks do not prevent every concurrent file replacement or changes to dependencies loaded later.

`UV_OFFLINE=1` in a worker is a uv setting, not process-level network enforcement or a description of resolver permissions.
R discovery/preparation is profile-free.
See [Requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md#host-resolution-and-trust) for supported request syntax and partial effects.

The [release trust audit](RESOLVER_RELEASE_AUDIT.md) is dated evidence, not approval of an arbitrary later commit.
[TODO](TODO.md) tracks remaining verification and design questions.
