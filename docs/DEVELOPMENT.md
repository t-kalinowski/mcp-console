# Development

Run commands from the repository root.
Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for change and publishing rules, [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for ownership, and [Boundary tests](../tests/boundaries/README.md) for behavioral evidence.

## Setup

Install Python 3.11+, Git, rustup, and platform build tools.
Use a Rust version satisfying `Cargo.toml`; the companion has its own pinned toolchain.
Python 3.13 matches the development-script CI environment.
[Release/build setup](../RELEASE.md#private-sandbox-executable) lists native prerequisites.

```sh
scripts/preflight
scripts/stage-sandbox-runner
scripts/with-checkout cargo build --release --target-dir target
```

`preflight` inventories tools, runtimes, staging, and caches without installing or building.
`--json` gives structured output.
Optional missing capabilities are reported, not evidence of a successful build.

For a source installation:

```sh
scripts/with-checkout uv tool install --reinstall .
```

Packaging stages its companion automatically; direct Cargo/Maturin builds need staging first.
Install the formatting tools used by `scripts/format`, including ruff, yamark, air, rustfmt, and Clippy for checking.

On native Windows use `.cmd` launchers, such as `scripts/check.cmd`, or `python scripts/check`.
Stage the companion before native build/test/check commands.
See [Windows validation](WINDOWS.md#validation) for provisioning and required runtimes.

### Windows development through WSL2

Use a Linux checkout, build directory, and runtime caches in the distro filesystem, such as `~/src/mcp-console`.
Do not share a Windows Git worktree or build output with Linux.
Separate distro clones test different userspaces but still share the WSL kernel.

Install Linux toolchains and the system libraries required by the selected R packages.
Prepare cold dependency caches serially before concurrent transcript runs.
Python 3.14 was not compatible with the existing isolated `sitecustomize` fixtures in the recorded setup; use the tested development Python until that fixture coverage is resolved.
See [TODO](TODO.md#sandbox-and-platforms).

## Validation ladder

| Command                             | Purpose                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/test --full --list`        | Discover functional cases without building.                                   |
| `scripts/test --locate SELECTOR`    | Find source and snapshots.                                                    |
| `scripts/test BOUNDARY/SUITE::CASE` | Focused red/green loop.                                                       |
| `scripts/test --update SELECTOR`    | Regenerate an intentional snapshot change; then rerun without `--update`.     |
| `scripts/format`                    | Format all supported sources; inspect every reported result and the diff.     |
| `scripts/check`                     | Ordinary final local gate. `--quick` is an alias, not a narrower gate.        |
| `scripts/check --full`              | Applicable functional, tooling, and installation checks.                      |
| `scripts/test --stress`             | Original allocation-scale workloads, separate from ordinary functional cases. |

Start behavior changes with a failing public regression.
For a refactor, establish the existing public baseline.
Run focused tests after editing, review formatter output and `git diff --check`, then run the appropriate final gate.
The formatter's default reporting can return success despite a formatter failure; do not ignore its output.

On macOS/Linux, the ordinary check includes staging, embedded-source/architecture checks, Rust formatting/Clippy/tests, a release build, and the smoke transcript profile.
On Windows it uses the staged companion, a debug build, and native acceptance.
The full gate adds applicable tooling, shared functional, and installation checks; installation runs last because it can replace staging/build directories.

CI runs the comprehensive profiles, including Unix allocation stress.
A focused local pass or capability skip does not validate another platform.
Report exact commands and missing coverage rather than “all tests pass.”

### Selecting and sizing test runs

Selectors retain their scope under every profile.
An unscoped full run audits orphan snapshots; only a successful full update removes them.
Focused updates preserve unselected cases.
Never hand-edit snapshots.

The shared selector syntax works on every platform.
Windows native cases also use `CLASS.CASE`, for example `WindowsConsole.test_python_without_r`.
`--list` and `--locate` do not acquire build ownership.

Use `--jobs N` and `--timeout SECONDS` for shared-case concurrency and deadlines.
The default concurrency is `max(2, 2 * N)` for logical CPU count `N`, with two cases when unavailable.
Set `MCP_CONSOLE_TEST_BINARY` to an absolute installed executable to skip the checkout build; sandbox cases still require its complete companion bundle.

[Boundary tests](../tests/boundaries/README.md) owns fixture, snapshot, capability, execution-mode, and cancellation details.
The [concurrency comparison](benchmarks/transcript-concurrency.md) is dated evidence, not proof of a universally optimal setting.

## Documentation website

Quarto renders top-level Markdown guides and benchmark pages directly.
R pkgdown and Python Great Docs add generated package sites.
Historical design sketches, task templates, and root/test documentation are not all published as website guides.

Keep Markdown usable in the repository.
The website filter takes page titles from first headings, rewrites links outside `docs/` to GitHub, and maps the R README and published package-reference URLs to local rendered pages.
Keep public filenames stable when possible; update references and navigation when adding or moving a page.

Install Quarto, R, pkgdown, and the R package dependencies:

```r
pak::pak(c("pkgdown", "local::r"))
```

```sh
uv venv .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r docs/requirements.txt
source .venv/bin/activate
quarto preview docs
```

On Windows use `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` and activate `.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`.

```sh
quarto render docs
python3 tests/website.py
```

The website test renders a fresh temporary copy and checks titles, navigation, search, and local links/anchors, including both package references.
Quarto's post-render scripts build `docs/_site/r/` and `docs/_site/python/`.
Python reference uses static source analysis; examples are displayed without execution, so API credentials and a Console executable are not required for that build.

Edit Python API docstrings and R roxygen sources for generated reference changes, not generated HTML.
The site configurations are `docs/_quarto.yml`, `great-docs.yml`, and `r/_pkgdown.yml`.
Generated build directories remain ignored.

### Documentation ownership

Public behavior belongs in the [API map](API.md) and its linked reference pages.
Architecture belongs in [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md); exact private message schemas belong with their source definitions.
Prefer a cross-reference over another explanation of restart, preparation, or sandbox trust.

Write procedures around a user's task.
Keep implementation algorithms, mutable file inventories, and one-off regression histories in source or dated evidence.
Record unfinished work in [TODO](TODO.md), with a link from the relevant guide; do not present future work as a supported option.

## Find the public test

Start at the outermost process boundary that observes the change.
Use `--full --list`, `--locate`, and scoped source searches.
Keep private-boundary tests specific to their seam instead of duplicating public text.

[Authoring cases](../tests/boundaries/AUTHORING.md) covers embedded programs and causal lifecycle fixtures.
Retain real-library sandbox regressions, including process creation and activation workflows; they test permissions that a trivial replacement program may not exercise.

## Review boundary

Before a cross-cutting change, identify its observable behavior, owning modules, public tests, expected platform/snapshot changes, and intended PR base.
Keep task-specific details in the checkpoint rather than permanent docs.

```sh
scripts/review-diff BASE
git diff --merge-base BASE
```

Use the intended parent for a stacked PR, not necessarily `main`.
Stage intended new files before measuring.
Line counts help review planning; they do not establish semantic scope.

## Checkout ownership

Build, staging, checking, and packaging share `.dev-workflow/checkout.lock`, outside `target`.
Use `scripts/with-checkout` for direct mutating Cargo/Maturin commands.
Do not delete locks, run concurrent nested mutators under one ownership token, or share application build/staging directories between checkouts.

Separate worktrees can run concurrently.
The pinned companion cache has its own shared staging lock.
Cancellation retains ownership until the workflow's process-cleanup contract completes; Windows phases use Jobs.
After owner crashes or forced termination, establish that surviving mutators stopped before restarting.
A stale lock diagnostic alone proves neither activity nor cleanup.

## Resume from a small checkpoint

Copy [the template](templates/task-checkpoint.md) to the ignored `.dev-workflow/task.md` for a new task.
Record scope, branch/base, revision, working edits, validation evidence, next action, and the requested stopping point.
Do not overwrite an existing checkpoint before checking it.

On resume compare it with Git status, HEAD, base, staged/unstaged diffs, and untracked files.
Validation records under `.dev-workflow/runs/` describe the revision/worktree at admission; an unfinished record does not prove a process is still running.
Establish cleanup with its original owner before rerunning.

Report actual validation and hosted CI/review status separately.
Opening a PR does not imply permission to merge, wait indefinitely for CI, or start a watcher.
