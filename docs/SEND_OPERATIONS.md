# Calls, input, and control

`send` operates on one session and accepts at most one complete `r`, `python`, or `sql` cell.
Submit cells sequentially and collect unfinished results before sending another cell.
See the [API reference](API.md) for argument types and limits.

## Cells and polling

```json
{ "python": "answer = 6 * 7; answer" }
```

If the response says `[running; poll with an empty send]`, send `{}` to collect more output.
Do not resubmit the source: the accepted cell continues and is not replayed.
New code is rejected while a cell or its uncollected result is active.

`timeout_ms` defaults to 60,000 and limits observation, not execution.
`0` observes immediately.
A long poll such as `{"timeout_ms": 300000}` returns early on completion or managed input; it avoids repeated short polls.

Completion returns text/images, or `[done]` when empty.
An idle poll returns pending idle output and `[idle]`.
Elapsed/phase notices describe observations, not a queue position or completion guarantee.

## Server readiness

MCP initialization, tool discovery, and ping do not wait for runtime preparation.
A valid early cell can be accepted while the shared startup continues.
Its observation deadline includes startup; timeout does not cancel it or create another worker.

An empty poll or requirements inspection can return `[worker starting]`.
Early standalone requirements that time out before readiness are not accepted and must be submitted again.
Once transport is ready, `[idle]` does not necessarily mean every interpreter startup hook has finished.

After initial setup failure, fix the reported problem and explicitly restart.
Ordinary calls retain the failure rather than retrying setup.
Rejected code and input are not replayed.

## Standard input and managed reads

`stdin` queues exact UTF-8 bytes.
It adds no newline, echoes nothing, and does not close the stream or acknowledge consumption.
Line-oriented input normally needs `\n`:

```json
{ "stdin": "yes\n" }
```

R `readline()` / `browser()` and main-thread Python `input()` / `pdb` can report `[waiting for stdin]`.
Answer with `stdin`, not another code cell.
In R's debugger, for example, `c\n` continues and `Q\n` quits.

Unread bytes can satisfy later reads and are discarded on restart.
Direct fd-0 and descendant reads bypass managed-input notifications.
Queue order does not determine which reader consumes the bytes.

## Interruption

```json
{ "control": "interrupt" }
```

Interrupt signals the active resolver, otherwise the current worker.
It does not start a missing worker or retarget a replacement.
Interruption is cooperative: code can catch, delay, or block it.
Use restart when fresh state is required.

A control-only interrupt may overlap a pending call.
If that call owns polling or output delivery, interrupt returns a running notice without consuming its output.
This is a control exception, not support for concurrent cells.

## Explicit restart

```json
{ "control": "restart" }
```

Restart prepares changed requirements before retiring the old worker.
Failed preparation preserves the old state.
After retirement begins, replacement failure cannot restore live objects.
Accepted requirements and recordings survive; language objects, database catalogs, and unread input do not.

A bundled cell or stdin reaches only the replacement after it is ready.
Native R startup and configured session startup can run again and repeat side effects.
No failed cell is automatically replayed.

## Operations

Prefer separate calls for control, dependency changes, and execution unless bundling serves a clear purpose.

| Call                                           | Effect order                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cell, with optional requirements/stdin         | Validate and prepare requirements, then admit the cell and deliver input.                                              |
| Requirements only                              | Validate and prepare; return `[prepared]`. Nonempty stdin is invalid.                                                  |
| Interrupt + cell                               | Deliver interrupt and input, allow interruption to settle, then prepare/admit the new cell only if prior work stopped. |
| Restart, with optional requirements/stdin/cell | Validate and prepare, commit requirements, retire, start replacement, deliver input/code.                              |
| Empty poll                                     | Collect output; do not start an initial or stopped worker.                                                             |
| Stdin only                                     | Queue input for the current generation and observe; after shared startup, it can start an initial/stopped worker.      |
| Requirements `get`                             | Read the committed declaration without consuming output.                                                               |

Structural errors are rejected before actions.
In the supported interrupt-plus-cell path, deferred requirement-content or policy errors occur **after** interrupt/input effects; those effects are not rolled back.
Interrupt with requirements but no cell is invalid.
Python-only sessions reject interrupt-plus-requirements entirely.

Changed `set`/`reset` normally needs explicit restart after user execution.
A still-unused prewarmed worker has a limited replacement exception; configured session startup or nonempty user input ends it.
See [Requirements actions](REQUIREMENTS.md#inspecting-and-replacing-requirements).

## Wait timing and cancellation

The observation deadline starts at call entry.
After startup, explicit preparation and control/retirement work can make the total call exceed it.
Standalone package preparation has no `timeout_ms` execution deadline.

Cancelling a request's wait after admission does not cancel the accepted cell or shared startup.
Poll to discover retained state.
Cancelling before admission leaves the cell unaccepted.
Closing the MCP connection instead triggers owned cleanup.

Outputs are bounded and consumed by polling.
Recovery after cancellation is not exactly-once client delivery: bytes can reach a client before cancellation settles.
A recorded result proves assembly, not receipt.
