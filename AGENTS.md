# Working on MCP Console

Read [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for setup and validation, [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for ownership, and the relevant contract from the [documentation index](docs/README.md).
Do not load every document for every task.
Source and public acceptance tests settle disagreements with prose.
`design-sketches/` contains proposals and history, not current requirements.

## Change discipline

Keep a behavior-changing PR to one observable change.
Aim for fewer than 500 added/deleted implementation lines, but prefer a coherent change to an artificial split; mechanical moves, tests, snapshots, and docs are exempt.

Start behavior changes with a failing public regression.
Establish an existing public baseline for internal refactors; do not test private helpers.
Preserve generation ownership and confirmed-retirement barriers.
Submitted code is shell-class capability; dependency preparation has a separate trust boundary and policy.

Console-owned private protocols evolve in lockstep without independent versions.
Update both endpoints and fixtures together.
Preserve external protocol versions, the separately pinned companion contract, and component/artifact identity checks.

Prefer event-driven waits with explicit cancellation.
Add abstractions for implemented responsibilities, not planned features.
Reassess large files rather than enforcing a line limit; retain one Cargo package until a concrete crate boundary emerges.
Keep production R/Python programs under `src/` compile-time embedded, not loaded from checkout files at runtime.

Update the owning document when a contract changes.
Explain decisions and invariants, not line-by-line mechanics.
Keep user contracts separate from developer internals.
Consolidate unfinished work in [TODO](docs/TODO.md); do not silently promote historical proposals into release requirements.

## Validation

```sh
scripts/preflight
scripts/test BOUNDARY/SUITE::CASE
scripts/format
scripts/check
```

Run `scripts/format` unchanged before committing and review all output: its default mode can report failures without failing the command.
Use `scripts/check` as the ordinary final gate; use `--full` when requested or appropriate to the change.
Report commands actually run and unavailable coverage.
CI is the comprehensive merge gate.

Use Windows `.cmd` launchers or explicit Python invocation there, and follow [Windows validation](docs/WINDOWS.md#validation).
Stage its companion before direct native checks.
Use `scripts/with-checkout` for direct build commands; never bypass checkout ownership locks or reuse a busy worktree.

## Tests and snapshots

Use temporary workspaces and `MCP_CONSOLE_HOME`, preserving `HOME` and the caller's tool environment.
Declare platform/capability requirements in shared test support.
Retain real-library sandbox regressions where the library's APIs exercise distinct permissions.

Never hand-edit `tests/snapshots/`.
Regenerate through `scripts/test --update` or formatting, inspect the diff, and rerun without `--update`.
Prefer shared cross-platform transcripts.
Make fixtures deterministic and normalize incidental paths/presentation only after assertions; preserve complete errors, tracebacks, status, and meaningful ordering.

Platform variants must test the exact differing contract and explain it in their decorator's `reason`.
Handshake defaults, line endings, or executable suffixes alone do not justify duplicating an otherwise portable test.
Keep initialization and tool discovery near the top, normally with the exact canonical `!same-as` comparison, and generally one Console invocation per transcript.
Different/incomplete exchanges remain in full.
Fix the producer or serializer rather than masking incorrect output.

Use readable multiline programs with `# fmt: r` or `# fmt: python` immediately above `code(` and its opening delimiter; indent the payload and closing delimiter one level deeper.
See [Boundary tests](tests/boundaries/README.md) and [Authoring](tests/boundaries/AUTHORING.md) for detailed rules.

## Local work and publishing

Verify any `.dev-workflow/task.md` against Git status when resuming.
Record the actual revision and evidence, not a generic “dirty” label or an old pass.

Before merging, require passing CI and a verified thumbs-up reaction from the GPT connector reviewer for the **current PR head**.
A completed review without findings is not approval.
Follow [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) before pushing a release tag.
Never yank or remove published PyPI files.
Respect the user's requested stopping point; do not infer merge or publication authorization.
