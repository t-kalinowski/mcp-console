# Authoring a boundary case

Locate a related case with `scripts/test --locate SELECTOR`, read its contract, and add a public regression before changing behavior.
Follow the [validation ladder](../../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#validation-ladder).

## Embedded programs

Use short strings for short fixtures and dedented multiline literals for longer programs.
Put `# fmt: python` or `# fmt: r` immediately above `code(` and its opening delimiter, including in nested calls.
Indent the payload and closing delimiter four spaces beyond that line:

```python
client.send(
    # fmt: python
    python=code(r"""
        for value in (1, 2):
            print(value)
        """),
)
```

Use raw literals when backslashes belong to the submitted program.
Preserve its indentation and trailing newlines.
Do not label a custom worker's command language as R/Python merely because it travels in that field.
Run `scripts/format` and inspect every formatter's result and the diff; `--strict` fails after attempting all formatters when any is missing or fails.

## Execution modes

For portable cases, use `@executions(DIRECT, SANDBOXED)` and `execution.serve()`; the fixture chooses sandboxing.
Put sandbox-only arguments in explicit sandbox fixtures, for example `SANDBOXED.serve("--writable-root", str(root))`, with the appropriate capability.
See [modes and requirements](README.md#requirements-and-execution-modes).

## Lifecycle receipts and checkpoints

Establish the observable state an assertion needs before releasing a fixture.
Use `FifoCheckpoint` (`support.checkpoints`), `read_lines` (`support.capture`), and `Events` (`support.events`) for blocking gates, complete stream receipts, and process transitions.
Keep cleanup in context managers or `finally` blocks.
Use `wait_for_path()` for known marker paths and worker-file discovery only for worker-owned directories whose names are initially unknown.
`FifoCheckpoint.release()` buffers an early token; `release_fixture_checkpoint()` instead waits for a real reader with a bounded rendezvous.
Pass the client when its exit should end that wait.
Marker waits subscribe to native filesystem/process events on macOS and Linux; Windows uses cancellable bounded path polling.
Pass an owned `Events` instance to `wait_for_path()` when the fixture needs explicit cancellation; `Events.cancel()` wakes the wait without a marker or client.

```python
client.send(python=program, timeout_ms=0)
assert last_tool_text(client) == "\n[running; poll with an empty send]"
started.wait("worker reached the release gate")
release.release()
```

A fixture marker alone does not prove public evaluation admission.
Writing a request to stdin does not prove its handler has started.
When cancelling a send during gated discovery, observe its exclusive polling claim before submitting a competing cell or cancellation.
Before closing input to check response delivery, gate an accepted result; EOF can cancel a call that has not been accepted yet.
Process startup does not prove a cell log has closed.
For shutdown output, establish cell completion and its recorded `cell_output` event before asserting which file owns later bytes.
Sleeps, broader matching, and longer timeouts do not establish ordering.

`wait_for_evaluation_output()` submits once, accumulates every text delta, and bounds transport receives with its completion budget.
Give cold preparation an explicit longer budget.
The default `send` observation deadline can return while setup is still running; establish completion before dependent requests.
Use the client's preparation budget for resolver collection and initial requirements inspection.
Use `McpClient.response_deadline()` for client-aware fixture waits so the remaining case deadline retains its shutdown and reap reserve.
Convert the absolute deadline to a nonnegative timeout immediately before blocking.
Retain raw exchanges when delivery or polling is the contract being tested.

See the [Python lifecycle cases](client_server/python/test_lifecycle.py) and [retention cases](client_server/output/test_spools.py).
Preserve complete output assertions and use the [snapshot rules](README.md#snapshots) for normalization.
